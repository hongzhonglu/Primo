\title{Append a Primo object.}
\usage{
append_Primo_obj(Primo_obj1, Primo_obj2)
}
\arguments{
\item{Primo_obj1}{list of results returned by Primo (from the function
\code{\link{Primo_tstat}}, \code{\link{Primo_pval}}, or \code{\link{Primo_ModT}}).}

\item{Primo_obj2}{list of results returned by Primo.}
}
\value{
A list of Primo results with the following elements:
\tabular{ll}{
\code{post_prob} \tab matrix of posterior probabilities
(rows are SNPs; columns are association patterns).\cr
\code{pis} \tab vector of estimated proportion of SNPs
belonging to each association pattern.\cr
\code{D_mat} \tab matrix of densities under each association pattern.\cr
\code{Gamma} \tab correlation matrix.\cr
}

\itemize{
\item If the results were originally from the \eqn{t}-statistic version,
the list will additionally contain:
\tabular{ll}{
\code{Tstat_mod} \tab matrix of moderated t-statistics.\cr
\code{V_mat} \tab matrix of scaling factors under the alternative distribution.\cr
\code{mdf_sd_mat} \tab matrix of standard deviation adjustment according to
 moderated degrees of freedom: df/(df-2).\cr
\code{prior_df} \tab vector of the prior degrees of freedom for each marginal distribution.\cr
\code{prior_var} \tab vector of the prior variance estimators for each marginaldistribution.\cr
\code{unscaled_var} \tab vector of the unscaled variance priors on non-zero coefficients
for each marginal distribution.
 }

\item If the results were originally from the \eqn{p}-value version,
the list will additionally contain:
\tabular{ll}{
\code{chi_mix} \tab matrix of \eqn{-2}log(\eqn{P})-values.\cr
\code{A} \tab vector of scaling factors under the alternative distributions.\cr
\code{df_alt} \tab vector of degrees of freedom approximated for the alternative distributions.\cr
 }
 }
}
\description{
Append two sets of Primo results. The function assumes that the two sets
share marginal distribution parameters and a common correlation structure.
Function may be used to append results from an initial run from Primo
with a run that used the same parameters (e.g. to account for missing SNPs)
